## üîÑ **Collaboration Workflow**

### **Daily Sync** (5 minutes)
- Share what you completed yesterday
- What you're working on today  
- Any blockers or questions
- **Format:** Quick message in shared chat

### **API Contract Agreement**
Before building UI components, agree on:
```typescript
// Example: Job API structure
interface Job {
  id: string
  title: string
  description: string
  hourlyRate: number
  shiftDate: Date
  location: string
  requirements: string[]
  status: 'active' | 'filled' | 'expired'
}
```

### **Branch Strategy**
```bash
# Friend creates feature branches:
git checkout -b feat/dashboard-enhancement
git checkout -b feat/profile-management

# AI creates feature branches:
git checkout -b feat/job-posting-api
git checkout -b feat/application-system
```

### **Code Review Process**
1. Create pull request when feature is ready
2. Other person reviews (or AI assists with review)
3. Address feedback
4. Merge to main branch

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Handoff Points**

### **Ahmed Needs from Kusai:**
1. **Job API endpoints** - GET /api/jobs, POST /api/jobs
2. **Profile API endpoints** - GET/PUT /api/profile
3. **Dashboard data endpoints** - GET /api/dashboard/stats
4. **TypeScript interfaces** for all data structures

### **Kusai Needs from Ahmed:**
1. **UI component interfaces** - what props components expect
2. **Form validation requirements** - what fields are required
3. **Mobile breakpoint decisions** - when to show/hide elements
4. **Design system choices** - colors, spacing, component styles
