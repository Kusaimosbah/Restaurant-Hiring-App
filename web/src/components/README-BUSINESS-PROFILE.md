# Business Profile Management Feature

This document provides an overview of the Business Profile Management feature implementation for the Restaurant Hiring App.

## Feature Overview

The Business Profile Management feature allows restaurant owners to:

1. Update basic restaurant information (name, description, business type, cuisine type, etc.)
2. Manage the restaurant's primary address
3. Add, edit, and delete multiple restaurant locations
4. Upload and manage restaurant photos (interior, exterior, food, staff)
5. Configure payment information and connect with Stripe

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema

The feature is built on the following Prisma models:

- `Restaurant`: Core model with basic restaurant information
- `Address`: One-to-one relation with Restaurant for the primary address
- `Location`: One-to-many relation with Restaurant for multiple locations
- `RestaurantPhoto`: One-to-many relation with Restaurant for photos
- `PaymentInfo`: One-to-one relation with Restaurant for payment details

### API Endpoints

The following API endpoints were implemented:

#### Restaurant Profile

- `GET /api/restaurant/profile`: Fetch restaurant profile with relations
- `PUT /api/restaurant/profile`: Update basic restaurant information

#### Restaurant Address

- `GET /api/restaurant/address`: Fetch restaurant's primary address
- `PUT /api/restaurant/address`: Update restaurant's primary address

#### Restaurant Locations

- `POST /api/restaurant/locations`: Create a new restaurant location
- `GET /api/restaurant/locations/:id`: Fetch a specific location
- `PUT /api/restaurant/locations/:id`: Update a specific location

### Frontend Components

The feature is implemented using the following React components:

- `BusinessProfile.tsx`: Main component with tabbed interface for all sections
- `BusinessDetailsForm.tsx`: Form for updating basic restaurant information

### Authentication and Authorization

All API endpoints and UI components are secured with NextAuth.js to ensure that:

1. Only authenticated users can access the feature
2. Only users with the `RESTAURANT_OWNER` role can access and modify their restaurant's profile

## Testing

A test script (`test-business-profile.ts`) is provided to verify the functionality of all API endpoints. To run the test:

```bash
cd web
npx ts-node src/test-business-profile.ts
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Photo Upload**: Implement actual file upload functionality with cloud storage integration
2. **Map Integration**: Add interactive maps for selecting location coordinates
3. **Stripe Integration**: Implement full Stripe Connect OAuth flow for payment processing
4. **Validation Improvements**: Add more comprehensive form validation and error handling
5. **Performance Optimizations**: Implement pagination for locations and photos lists
